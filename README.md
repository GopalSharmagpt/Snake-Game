# Snake-Game

My name is Gopal Sharma and I have created this Snake Game using only Python.

Snake Game 🐍

Welcome to my Snake Game project! This is a classic snake game built using Python. The game features a snake that grows in length each time it eats food, and the goal is to make the snake as long as possible without running into walls or itself.

Features:
●  Colorful Graphics: The snake and food have distinct colors for better visibility.
●  Sound Effects: Enjoy sound effects for eating food and game over scenarios.
●  Customizable: Easily change the colors and other game elements in the code.
●  Responsive Controls: Smooth and responsive controls for an enjoyable gameplay experience.
